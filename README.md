## Brief intro
Amphibia is a Disney TV show. It followed the adventure of Anne Boonchuy into Amphibia. Throughout the show, Anne displayed growth as she navigated through Amphibia with the Plantars who took her in as an adopted member of the family. 

I love the shows for a few reasons:

* Diversity & inclusion: It’s the first show that portrays SE Asian as the lead that I’ve seen
* Character progression: The characters aren’t all black & white. The characters change from evil to good. Anne showed massive changes from being an self-centered person to one who puts others before herself!
* Found family trope: I’m a sucker for stories where characters found a family that are not related by blood! The Plantars took Anne in when nobody would. Hop Pop even claimed Anne to be her adopted grand-daughter!
* Community: The frogs live in a community and everyone knew each other. The same happened when Anne went back to Earth - the Thai community came together to support her!


I really love the show and decided to create a viz for it. The notebooks contain the code I used:
* Scraping fandom.ipynb -> contains the  code I used to scrape fandom for the scripts
* Scraping imdb.ipynb -> contains the code I used to scrape IMDB for the ratings
* cleaning.ipynb -> contains the code I used to do the final cleaning and joining the data from the Fandom to ratings data
* Sentiment_analysis.ipynb -> contains the code I used to perform simple sentiment analysis on the lines

## Limitations
There are several limitations to this project:

- Not all episodes have their scripts uploaded
- There are limitations to webscrapping - not everything was uploaded in the same format. Some have multiple formats (think texts & tables) which made it difficult to get them perfectly right

## Tableau viz
I've turned the data into a viz on Tableau. Have a look [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/han2134) and let me know if you have any constructive feedback!
